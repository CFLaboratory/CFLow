# CFLow

CFLow (part of the Computational Fluids Laboratory) is a general purpose CFD solver.
A particular goal with `CFLow` is to investigate the use of modern programming techniques for
developing high performance CFD codes that are portable across CPU and accelerated architectures and
scale from laptop/workstations up to supercomuters.

## Roadmap

A roadmap outlining the plans for `CFLow` v1.0 is available in the [ROADMAP](doc/ROADMAP.md) file.

## License

CFLow is available under the Apache 2.0 License, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) file.
